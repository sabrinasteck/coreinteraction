        <code>index.html</code> is the standard naming convention for the primary HTML file in a directory. The browser will assume that a URL requesting a directory is actually looking for the index.html file. In other words <q>www.website.com/index.html</q> and <q>www.website.com</q> are exactly the same thing to a browser.
       
        <!-- THIS IS AN HTML COMMENT. YOU CAN ORGANIZE THOUGHTS, WRITE YOURSELF NOTES, OR USE THESE AS SEPERATORS WITHIN YOUR .HTML TO MAKE IT MORE SCANNABLE ETC. -->
        
        <!--THESE <br> TAGS CREATE LINE BREAKS WITHIN TEXT -->

       Move into a folder by using the following convention<code> "folder name/"</code>. For instance, the image below is 2 folders away (relative to this file). So the path is <code>"assets/img/YOURFILESNAME.jpg"</code>. See this working below.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/img/fileStructure.jpg" />
        
       <p>
       This works the same for find other .html pages in the structure. For instance:
       
       <a href="pages/page2.html"> Go to a page in a folder</a>
        
        <!-- THE LINK IS CONTAINED IN QUOTES -->
